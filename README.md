## Unofficial banking companion app for monopoly board games.

This app replaces the play money in Monopoly board games. Instead, every player can see his money balance on his phone and make transactions through the app easily.

![App Showcase Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20878653/137903004-fd057f36-bee9-48ce-84a8-1923a55ce6ef.png)

A demo is available on [monopoly-banking.web.app](https://monopoly-banking.web.app/).

How to use this app:
1. All players have to open the website (or install the app on their phone).
2. One player creates a new game.
3. All players connect to this game.
4. Now all transactions can be done via the app, e.g. sending a player money or getting money from the bank.
5. Have fun ðŸ˜€

NOTE: This project is still in the early stages. If you have ideas, find bugs or have suggestions, just [open an issue](https://github.com/devj3ns/monopoly-banking/issues/new) :).
